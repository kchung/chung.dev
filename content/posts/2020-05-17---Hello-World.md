I don't write that much. It's always been on my todo list of things to incorporate into my life.

The last time I started a blog was around 2011. It was built on the hottest tech during that time, Ruby On Rails. Rails was overkill for what I wanted in my simple blog. I think the anxiety of maintaining the application and keeping it up to date scared me away.

Eight years later, I knew I needed something simple. As a prerequisite, I didn't want to maintain a server for the blog. On this warm Sunday afternoon, I set up a fully working blog in a few hours. I settled with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Simple. Free.

I hope to write more. The audience for this blog will be me but will be mindful of observers from the internet who may stop by.
