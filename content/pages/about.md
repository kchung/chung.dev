Hi, my name is Kevin and I'm currently located in San Francisco, California.

I'm a Senior Software Engineer at [Square](https://squareup.com/) building the ecommerce platform that powers the Square Online Store. Previously, I worked at [Weebly](https://www.weebly.com) (which was acquired by Square).

I am exploring some ideas I've been thinking about, so this blog serves to capture my learnings from not reading docs, running into cryptic error messages, and coding myself into holes.

I mainly write these blog posts for myself, but if someone happens to stumble upon this site, hopefully they can benefit from my struggles.
